Compress the given text in a way that fits in a tweet (ideally) and such that you (GPT) can 
reconstruct the intention of the human who wrote text as close as possible to the original intention. 
This is for yourself. It does not need to be human readable or understandable. 
Abuse of language mixing, abbreviations, symbols (unicode and emoji), or any other encodings 
or internal representations is all permissible, as long as it, if pasted in a new inference cycle, 
will yield near-identical results as the original text.
